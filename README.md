# Automonous-Driving-Vehicle
An Autonomous Driving Vehicle (ADV) is fundamentally defined as a passenger vehicle that drives itself. In future the automated systems are used to avoid accidents and reduce congestion. ADV will be capable of determining the best route and warn each other about the conditions ahead. Our ADV designed is a basic type, which can work using lane detection, pedestrian detection and obstacle detection using cameras, laser range finder and sensors. The concepts involved are deep learning and image processing. The control mechanism consists of stepper motors, servo motors and DC motors. Using speech processing, ADV can also be driver assistance
